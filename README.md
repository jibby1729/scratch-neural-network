# scratch-neural-network
This is an implementation of a feed-forward neural network (aka multi-layer perceptron) by hand, ie without referring to in-built neural network functions in Pytorch. This is mostly so that I learn, but also serves as a good way to compare in-built implementations to theoretical implementations. The motivation for this is mostly Feynman's quote: "What I cannot create, I do not understand" which should be applied rather conservatively (no, you do not have to recreate everything you work with), but makes the most sense when applied to foundational ideas (such as neural networks).
