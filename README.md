# scratch-neural-network
This is an implementation of a feed-forward neural network (aka multi-layer perceptron) by hand, ie without referring to in-built neural network functions in Pytorch. This is mostly so that I learn, but also serves as a good way to compare in-built implementations to theoretical implementations.
